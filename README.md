# Circularly-LinkedList
Java implementation of Circularly Linked Lists & some practice algorithms

## About

It is a homework for Akdeniz University Computer Science Department - Data Structures Lecture.

* Exercise 1. There are two circularly linked lists, L and M. This is a Java application for telling if L and M store the same sequence of elements (but perhaps with different starting points).

* Exercise 2.  Given a circularly linked list L containing an even number of nodes, this is a Java application how to split L into two circularly linked lists of half the size.

## Built With

* Java

## Getting Started


* ```sh
   javac Exercise1.java

   ```
* ```sh
   java Exercise1

   ```
